            <b>Robert James Fischer </b> (March 9, 1943 – January 17, 2008) was
            an American <span>chess grandmaster</span> and the eleventh
            <span>World Chess Champion. </span> A
            <span> chess prodigy,</span> he won his first of a record eight
            <span>US Championships </span> at the age of 14. In 1964, he won
            with an 11–0 score, the only perfect score in the history of the
            tournament. Qualifying for the
            <span>1972 World Championship,</span> Fischer swept matches with
            Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen by 6–0 scores. After winning another
            qualifying match against <span>Tigran Petrosian,</span> Fischer won
            the title match against <span>Boris Spassky </span> of the USSR, in
            Reykjavík, Iceland. Publicized as a
            <span>Cold War </span> confrontation between the US and USSR, the
            match attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship
            before or since.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1975, Fischer <span>refused to defend h</span> is title when an
            agreement could not be reached with <span>FIDE,</span> chess's
            international governing body, over the match conditions.
            Consequently, the Soviet challenger <span>Anatoly Karpov </span> was
            named World Champion by default. Fischer subsequently disappeared
            from the public eye, though occasional reports of erratic behavior
            emerged. In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial
            <span>rematch against Spassky. </span> It was held in
            <span>Yugoslavia,</span> which was under a United Nations embargo at
            the time. His participation led to a conflict with the US
            government, which warned Fischer that his participation in the match
            would violate an <span>executive order </span> imposing US sanctions
            on Yugoslavia. The US government ultimately issued a warrant for his
            arrest. After that, Fischer lived as an émigré. In 2004, he was
            arrested in Japan and held for several months for using a passport
            that the US government had revoked. Eventually, he was granted
            <span>Icelandic citizenship </span> by a special act of the
            Icelandic parliament, allowing him to live there until his death in
            2008.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fischer made numerous lasting contributions to chess. His book
            <span>My 60 Memorable Games, </span> published in 1969, is regarded
            as essential reading in chess literature. In the 1990s, he patented
            a modified chess timing system that added a time increment after
            each move, now a standard practice in top tournament and match play.
            He also invented Fischer random chess, also known as
            <span>Chess960,</span> a chess variant in which the initial position
            of the pieces is randomized to one of 960 possible positions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fischer made numerous <span>antisemitic statements,</span> including
            <span>Holocaust denial.</span> His antisemitism was a major theme in
            his public and private remarks, and there has been widespread
            comment and speculation concerning his psychological condition based
            on his extreme views and eccentric behavior.
